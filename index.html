            <p>This is another challenge from <a href="https://mavenanalytics.io" style="color: white;">Maven Analytics</a> that uses a data base simulating the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including Maven Analytics (<a href="https://mavenanalytics.io" style="color: white;">https://mavenanalytics.io</a>) promotional offers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key objective for the challenge:</h2>
            <p>After running a test by sending different combinations of promotional offers to existing rewards members, we now have a 30-day data base of strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> the task is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Find a persona target for a new marketing promotion/campaign after a previous promotion test during 30 days.</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data analysis:</h2>
            <p>With python and power query I first did data preparation (extraction, cleaning and formatting);</p>
            <p>Next steps was data modeling and metrics in order to find questions/answers that the data analysis could give (about the events, customer segments and offers).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Assumptions:</h2>
            <ul class="assumptions">
                <li>1. There seem to be some errors with customers who are 118 years old with no gender and no income (removed from the analysis – despite having transactions – to focus on the target persona);</li>
                <li>2. The events per se don't actually tell me anything about the channel, there's nothing specifying if it was e-mail, mobile, social media, or all of events</li>
                <li>3. In theory, the person receives, sees and completes the offer but there are case/events where the person has received and completed the events</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section findings">
            <h2>Findings:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- 91.18% valid offer transaction;</li>
                <li>- 23.86% of transactions came from offers;</li>
                <li>- 55.60% of received offers was converted;</li>
                <li>- "bogo" had 57.50% of converted offer in trasaction meanwhile discount offer had a 64.45%;</li>
                <li>- Although man are the majority of customers, women have highest income and highest mid-ticket;</li>
                <li>- The more representative age group is 36-65;</li>
                <li>- Women have the highest percentage of converted offer in transaction as well the group age 65+ (for me was kinda surprisenly);</li>
                <li>- Tenure doesn´t seen to be relevant for defining the persona because the average tenure is (in general) nearly 7,5 years and doesn´t differ much between age groups. But this info shows that this Cafe should keep these good customers as well to acquire new customers;</li>
                <li>- It's funny to see some transaction values like $800, $900, or even $1000+ (paying off a big monthly bill?.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section recommendations">
            <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
            <h2>Persona:</h2>
            <p>Marketing has many facets and depends a lot on what you want to do and what audience you want to reach. The data showed me great potential for increasing younger customers. 
                So, base on data analysis, the focus should be on attracting and retaining young female customers and for this I create a "persona target".</p>
            <p>Jane Doe, age 26, does not know the Cafe yet, use more social media and mobile and prefer discount vouchers/coupons.</p>
            <h2>Marketing campaign/promotion:</h2>
            <p>To attract and retain new customers with a focus on the "persona target" I would launch a promotion discount using cashback and coupons. 
                The ideia is first to have a minimum purchase amount of $10, second, where to use the coupon, the person has to spend at least 3x the value of the coupon they have. 
                Kind of any purchase with 10% cashback. For example, if I make a $10 purchase, I receive a discount coupon worth $1, and to use this discount, I need to spend at least $3 more. 
                In this way, it's more likely to generate repeat purchases and customer loyalty.</p>

            <h2>Tools:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Python (data preparation: cleaning and formating the data base);</li>
                <li>- Power Query (data modeling: creation of dimension tables, grouping tables);</li>
                <li>- Power BI (data analysis: measures, charts, report);</li>
                <li>- Excel (.csv database);</li>
                <li>- PowerPoint (dashboard page structure).</li>
